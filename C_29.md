# Topic : Catapult and the Rubber Band

##### Objectives:

* ###### Place the images of the catapult in the game. 

* ###### Use color picker to pick colors for the rubber. 

* ###### Draw the rubber band for the catapult.

##### STEPS:

1. git clone the activity link for this class

   > $ git clone https://github.com/gargiaero/C_29_typora_-_visual_code_studio

   

2.  There are three images added to the sprites directory - sling1.png, sling2.png and sling3.png.

   * We will be needing to use these images to create our catapult.

   * Since, the catapult itself doesn't interact with any object in the game, we can keep it as a static image - we need not create a body for this.

   * We can load and place the image in the game using image() function in p5.js.

   * Looks through the p5 documentation for image() function.

   *  Load the images inside the constructor for slingshot class and position it inside the display() function. 

   * Write code to load the images in the constructor of slingshot. 

   * Write code to position the images in the game using image() function. Use trial and error to position the image.

   * Run the code and shows the output.

   * Ok, we seem to have the catapult in the right position. Our bird needs to be higher.

   * We will have to change the position for both the bird and the point to which it is anchored. 

   * Modifies script.js to change the position of the bird and the point to which it is anchored. 

   * Use trial and error to find the positions. Run the code and shows the output.

   * Wow, we have the catapult and the bird in between the two ends.

   * But we don't want the line from the anchor point. Put comments at the line() in the display function and runs the code.

   3.  We do want two rubber bands from either end of the catapult. 

      * How will we get that? 

      * What color would be these rubber bands / lines?

      * Any ideas on how we can identify the exact color and draw the line using the same color? 

      * All colors are made up of red, green and blue. 

      * There are thousands of colors by combining different amounts of red, green and blue. 

      * Fortunately, we have color pickers which can pick up the color from the screen and tell us the right amount of red, green and blue needed to make the color. 

      * Install and use the ColorZilla chrome extension (Student Activity 3) and use it to identify the color of the rubber band.

      *  Choose the color of the rubber band using the ColorZilla chrome plugin's color picker tool. 

      * Use the color as the stroke color.

      *  Draw line 1 from one end of the catapult to behind the bird.

      * Draw line2

      4.  Load - sling3.png - and positions it behind the bird as the base of the rubber band. Runs code and checks the output.

      5. Great! We have the rubber band effect of the catapult ready. Now, there is only one small problem. 

         * Observe what happens when the rubber band is pulled ahead of the catapult.

         *  the base of the rubber band is still behind the bird even when the bird is pulled forward to the catapult.

         * We can use conditional programming to draw different lines at different end points depending on the position of the bird with respect to the catapult. 

         * Run code and checks the output.

           6. Adjust the strokeWeights so that the rubber band appears thinner when the bird is pulled forward.

              * write the code to draw the lines at different end points.

                

              * Run the code to see the output.

                #### Wow! Great job. Our grand catapult is ready to fire at the pigs.

                

   ### We want a way to make the pig disappear from the game after it has been hit. We might want to add the score and other small things which we will cover in our next class.
